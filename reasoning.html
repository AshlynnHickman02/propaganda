    <h1>Reasoning</h1>
    <p>This is where I explain why Math should instead only be required once.</p>

    <h1>Careers</h1>
    <p>There are many careers out there that do not require a strong understanding of math; at the very least, the math
      used would be at 7th grade level. These careers that include little to no math are those like firefighting,
      professional sports, artists booth visual and musical, etc. </p>

    <h1>So Why Should Math be an Elective?</h1>
    <p>Math should be an elective only required once because not all career fields require a high level of math
      education. If anything, it's a waste of time and puts students behind on what they could be studying for thier
      perferred future career choice, still allowing those who'd like to have a techincal career to take those classes.
      For example, Algebra 1-2 would be required, but students who want to be math teachers would take those extra
      classes in the math field. Students who want to be an architect will take geometry it is required to know basic
      geometry to become an architect.</p>
