    <h1>Statistics</h1>
    <p>Here are the statistics of mathematics in highschool, including passing rates, failing rates, and how much time
      the subject wastes.</p>
  </section>
  <section id=explain>
    <h1>Passing Rates</h1>
    <p>Before fall break, students were required to take Benchmarks for the Math and English subjects. The math
      benchmark was called the ACT Benchmarks, and it's shocking to see how many students passed even a 4th grade
      question. Only 31.77% of students who took the ACT Benchmarks at Valley Vista Highschool passed a 4th grade
      question. Additionally, only 10.54% of Valley Vista students passed a 5th grade question.</p>
  </section>
  <section id=explain>
    <h1>Failing Rates</h1>
    <p>Only 50% of students pass with a C and above. That's quite a gawking number of students not being able to
      graduate because they failed their math class.</p>
  </section>
  <section id=explain>
    <h1>The Amount of Time Math Wastes</h1>
    <p>Highschool students are very busy trying to juggle each class, clubs, work, and sports. 3.3 million students
      attending Highschool in the United States have a job. That's at least 5 hours off a weekday. 7.9 million students
      are in sports or clubs, taking at least 2 hours off of their time daily. 1.4 million student in the U.S. are
      taking AP classes, which after school can take at least an hour or two to complete the work for that class,
      considering it is a college elective. Math homework in highschool can take from 90 minutes to 2 hours. So,
      altogether, that leaves the student 11 hours after school. If school would end everywhere at 2:15, the student
      would go to sleep at 9pm, no including chores at home, other classes' homework and projects, and self care. That's
      a lot of time put to waste.</p>
